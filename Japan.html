     <h3> Shibuya Station Redevelopment </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> The Shibuya Station is an underground subway station that serves many people that are
trying to get to work, but is also surrounded by an abundance commercial areas. It is one of Japans
most dense districts, because of this, the Shibuya area has gone through and is going to go through
       some changes.</h4>
     <br>
     <h4> Tokyo Corporation, East Japan Railway Company and Tokyo Metro Co., Ltd, had proposed
some plans to the Governor of Tokyo to undergo an urban planning project. This plan involves three
areas above and around Shibuya station, these areas being the Shibuya Station Area, Shibuya Station
South Area, and Shibuya Dogenzaka Area. The primary focus of this plan is to: “1) form a network for
pedestrians that is comfortable and easy to understand by strengthening the function of
transportation nodes; 2) adopt an urban function that increases the appeal of the city as the genesis
of lifestyle and culture and elevates its international competitiveness; and 3) strengthen the area’s
       disaster-preventing function and improve the environment”. </h4>

     <h3> Shibuya Station Area </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> The Shibuya station area is located directly above Shibuya Station. This area is the going to
be the primary attraction to the area. A 46-storey building (approximately 230 meters high), is going
to be built on the proposed area. The plan is to have offices on the higher levels of the building and
commercial facilities on the middle and lower floors. Pedestrian walkways and plazas will also be
       integrated into the development of this area. </h4>
     <br>
     <h4> By implementing these plans, the congestion of foot traffic will be greatly reduced, therefore
increasing the safety of pedestrians when using Shibuya Station. Furthermore, by creating
commercial and office buildings, it is thought that more domestic and overseas corporations will go
to Shibuya, thus increasing the growth of creative content industries and increasing the number of
       visitors to Shibuya. </h4>

     <h3> Shibuya Station South Area </h3>

     <h4> The Shibuya Station South Area is planned to have a 33-storey building (approximately 180
meters high). This building will be multifunctional as office building will be located at the higher
levels while the middle and lower levels will be used for creative content industries. The area will
also be filled with pedestrian pathways, underground pathways and green walkways. All of this is to
       be located next to the Shibuya river, adding to the attractiveness of the area. </h4>
     <br>
     <h4>
 The Shibuya Station South area will host a new entrance into the underground subway
station. By doing this it alleviates traffic amongst other entrances, as well as creating traffic and visitability
to this new area of Shibuya. The content creative industries in this area is planned to bring in
more industries from around the world, hence leading to the growth of the industry within Japan. </h4>

     <h3> Conculsion </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> To assess the success of the proposed urban transformation plan of the Shibuya Station
Areas data will need to be collected. The proposed plan states that they plan to bring in more visitors
and both domestic and international industries to Shibuya, data which could help see if this is
successful would be: the number of tourists to visit the area (prior vs new), the number of industries
to have moved into the area (prior vs new), and possible the economy of the district (prior vs new).
The plan also implies that it wants to decrease the congestion of foot traffic in the area, data that
could be useful in determining the success of this could be: the density/congestion of the entrances 
into the station (prior vs new), or the density/congestion of walkways in general (prior vs new).
Another aspect that the plan touched on was the safety of pedestrians in terms of the congestion of
traffic and in the case of a disaster, data that could determine if the plan was successful in this regard
could be the number of injuries that was caused due to congested walkways/entrances (prior vs new),
the number percentage of people evacuated in the case of a disaster(prior vs new), or traffic
       accidents caused buy congested crossings (prior vs new). </h4>
