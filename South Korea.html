<h2>Dongdaemun Area Regeneration : Dongdaemun Design Plaza</h2>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3> Purpose: </h3> 
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> The Dongdaemun Area of South Korea was a “naturally-formed centre of fashion and design” 
       (Role of Governance in Urban Transformation of Seoul, 2017, pg. 40), the creation of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP)
       was provided as a core-foundation to visualise that the Dongdaemun Area was being revitalised. The DDP established a 
       “downtown economy as the growth engine of design and creative industries in the recessed downtown, 
       to build an international exchange network as a global source of design and creative industries,
       and to serve as a hub of East Asia culture and tourism” (Seoul Solution for Urban Development, 2015, pg.212). The key
     objectives that the Seoul Metropolitan Governement aim to achieve for this project was to;</h4>
     <br>
     <h4> 1. Develop creative design industries <br> 2. A base for designers and companies to strategize <br> 3. Global Design-knowledge exchange system
       <br> 4. Internation platform for designer's network <br> 5. Hub for cultural and art activities <br> 6. Make it a tourist site <br> 7. having a creative atmospheric environment </h4>
          <br>

         <h4> 
       The construction of the DDP was initiated through a competition, where the Seoul Metropolitan Government 
       held the contest to promote this project on an international scale. The competition was announced in April 2007 
       where architect Zaha Hadid won with her design of the DDP in August 2007. </h4>

     <h3> Process of how the DDP was created: </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> The DDP designed by Zaha Hadid, was built with 4 underground floors and 3 aboveground stories.
       On March 21st, 2014 the DDP was opened to the public. Through the use of 3D Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
       Hadid was able to create a “set of inter-related spatial relationships which will define the social interactions and 
       behavioural structure in/around the project” (Zaha Hadid DDP, Ella Thorns, 2018). This enables the interactions between 
       both the inner fashion exhibitions and the outdoor street fashion shops. The 38,000 square metre cultural complex that 
       Hadid completed with an aluminium façade provided a hub for design and technology, along with a park becoming a green 
       oasis to balance the weight between Technology and Nature. </h4>

     <h3> Conflicts: </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> Conflict with Korean athletic circles: The Civic Network for Justice in Sports (CNJIS) were against the removal of the Dongdaemun 
       Stadium as the previous buildings before the DDP was constructed as the local citizens adored their love of sports. </h4>
     <br>
     <h4> Conflict with the merchants: The DDP forced the merchants to relocate themselves out of the area that the DDP was being made.
       Merchants such as the traditional marketers, street vendors, shop owners and underground shopping centres. 
       They opposed to this project as they thought it would’ve affected their businesses and income. </h4>
     <br>
     <h4> Conflict with cultural heritage conservation groups: Cultural Solidarity carried out a campaign towards the demolishment 
       of the Dongdaemun Stadium, as they argued to be considered it having historic and cultural value, during the modern times of 
       Korea where Japanese colonization occurred during the Korean War. </h4>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3> Outcomes: </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> Nurturing design industries: Holding one of the largest Seoul Fashion Week due to the opening of the DDP,
       to display the young-minded fashion designers enhancing the competitiveness against brand name-levelled designers. 
       It has created new business opportunities on an international scale. The continuation of fashion shows and fashion fairs 
       and other events helps the revitalisation of the Dongdaemun Area </h4>
     <br>
     <h4> Revitalising tourism: Increase of 10% in tourists visiting to the DDP having an average of 24,000 visitors 
       which is 1.5x the amount expected before the project was put into action. </h4>
     <br> 
     <h4> Better Conflict Management: The Seoul Metropolitan Government was given an opportunity to help fix the conflicts 
       that had occurred during the production of the DDP, by creating management teams to aid public projects. </h4>
