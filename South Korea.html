<h2>Dongdaemun Area Regeneration : Dongdaemun Design Plaza</h2>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <divi> Dongdaemun Design Plaza (henceforth called, “DDP”) was planned as a landmark to grow the downtown
economy as the growth engine of design and creative industries in the recessed downtown, to build an international
exchange network as a global source of design and creative industries, and to serve as a hub of
East Asian culture and tourism. To implement the plan, 8 strategic objectives were established: development
of creative and future design, strategic base of design business, global design knowledge exchange system,
designer network platform, hub of cultural and art activities, global landmark to create a tourism brand, creative
environment and place identity, and downtown trading area promotion program. </divi>
