<h2>Dongdaemun Area Regeneration : Dongdaemun Design Plaza</h2>

     <h3> Purpose: </h3> 
     <br>
     <br>
     <h4> The Dongdaemun Area of South Korea was a “naturally-former centre of fashion and design” (Role of Governance in Urban Transformation of Seoul, 2017, pg. 40), the creation of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) was provided as a core-foundation to visualise that the Dongdaemun Area is being revitalised. The DDP established a “downtown economy as the growth engine of design and creative industries in the recessed downtown, to build an international exchange network as a global source of design and creative industries, and to serve as a hub of East Asia culture and tourism” (Seoul Solution for Urban Development, 2015, pg.212). </h4>
